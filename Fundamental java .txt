1) what is the programing languges?
Ans:Programming languages are formal languages used to write instructions that can be executed by a computer. 
They provide a structured and systematic way of communicating with computers to perform specific tasks or solve problems. 
Programming languages allow developers to create software, websites, mobile applications, games, and other digital products.

2) Why do you need programing languges?
Ans:Programming languages are essential tools for instructing computers to perform specific tasks or solve problems. 
Here are several reasons why programming languages are needed
Computer Instructions: Computers operate on machine code, which consists of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that are directly understood by the hardware. 
Software Development: Programming languages enable developers to create software applications, websites, mobile apps, games, and other digital products.
Problem Solving: Programming languages provide a structured and systematic approach to problem-solving. 

3) what is features of java ?
Ans:Object-Oriented - The features of object-oriented programming are supported by Java. Its object model is 
straightforward and flexible
Platform independent - Because Java and C++ are platform independent, application programs created in 
one Operating system can run on any other Operating system. C and C++, however, are platform 
dependent languages, making it impossible for application programs created in one Operating system to 
run in any other Operating systemh
Simple - Because Java incorporates many C/C++ capabilities, it is simple to understandable
Secure - Java offers a variety of defences against malware and viruses. It guarantees that neither damage 
nor security will be compromisedh
Portable - We have the idea of portability in Java. Java allows the same software to run on various 
platformsh
Robust - It assists us in identifying potential errors as soon as feasible during program developmenth
Multi-threaded - Java's multithreading programming capability enables you to create a program that 
executes multiple tasks concurrently
Distributed -Java maintains the TCP/IP protocol and is therefore suitable for distributed Internet 
environments.

4) what is an objects?
Ans : An object is an entity with state and behaviour, such as a chair, bike, marker, pen, table, or car. It could be 
intellectual or physical (tangible and intangible). The banking system is an illustration of an intangible entity.
An object has three characteristics:
State: represents an object's data (value)
Behavior: represents how an object behaves (or how it functions), such as when you deposit or withdraw 
money
Identity: Usually, a distinct ID is used to implement an object's identification. The external user cannot see 
the value of the ID. However, the JVM uses it internally to uniquely identify each object.Pen, for instance, is an object. Reynolds is its name; its state is noted as being white. Writing is its behaviour 
because it is utilized for writing.
A class's instances are objects. A class serves as a model or blueprint from which new objects can be made. 
Therefore, a class's instance (or result) is an object.

5) what is a class?
Ans: A class is a collection of items with similar characteristics. It serves as a model or blueprint from which things 
can be made. It makes sense as a whole. It cannot be bodily.

In java in  class could inclde:
 Fields
 Methods
 Constructors
 Blocks
 Nested class and interface
